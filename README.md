This piece of code was based off materials worked on in class. It displays shapes such as spot, square and triangle using classes.
It uses different keyPressed options to move these shapes. 


When you run this program it will display three white shapes(spot, square and triangle). You can press 'l', 'r', 'u', and 'd' (and also available in capital letters) and these buttons will move the shapes. 

The 'l' will move the shapes to the left, the 'r' will move the shapes to the right, the 'u' will move the shapes up and the 'd' will move the shapes down. I have set boundaries so that all shapes will not leave the display screen.

I also found the since all shapes can end up hiding behind eachother, I set the colours to be transparent so you can see each shape behind eachother. I added another addition colour that when any of the 'l', 'r', 'u', 'd' a new 
random colour will apply to all the shapes. 

I also decided to add another method that would grow each of the shapes and within that method it will also shrink. When pressing on the left mouse button it will increase the shape size and when pressing on the right button it 
will decrease the shape size. I also set boundaries on these so that the shapes do not get any bigger than 350px and no smaller than 10px.


** NB **
The method for growing and shrinking the triangle does not work as intended. The triangle moves down to the right when left clicked and up to the left when right clicked.
